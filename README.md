# AlexNet-using-the-CIFAR10-dataset
We train a deep convolutional neural network to perform image classification. In fact, this is a slight variation of a network called *AlexNet*. This is a landmark model in deep learning, and arguably kickstarted the current (and ongoing, and massive) wave of innovation in modern AI when its results were first presented in 2012. AlexNet was the first real-world demonstration of a *deep* classifier that was trained end-to-end on data and that outperformed all other ML models thus far.
